# The Effect of Medicaid Expansion on the Medicare Population

While the Affordable Care Act of 2010 expanded health care access to millions of Americans, it is
unclear how specifically the expansion of Medicaid has affected preventative health outcomes in the
United States. We aim to investigate through regression techniques if there are significant associations
between expanding Medicaid and preventative health outcomes, particularly in the population aging into
Medicare. Using regression techniques on publicly available Medicare data, we have found that states
with Medicaid expansion have significantly lower rates of preventable hospital admissions, HCC scores,
emergency room usage, and higher rates of outpatient visits among the Medicare beneficiary population,
controlling for a selection of demographic factors.
